# Be A Star (Frontend)

This is a mobile AR app built on [ViroReact](https://docs.viromedia.com) built for the [Mixed Reality Solar System Challenge](https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki/A-Mixed-Reality-Solar-System).

In this AR game, users play as stars that try to grow large enough to steal other players' planets!

The backend counterpart to this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/HackTheSolarSystem/beAStar-back)
